# Chromatic Puzzle ðŸŽ¹

This is a music inspired slide puzzle based on the C Chromatic scale where you really have to listen to be able to solve it! </br>
For those that do not have perfect pitch (including myself), I have visually associated each tile according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromesthesia"> Scriabin's sound-to-color associations</a>.
